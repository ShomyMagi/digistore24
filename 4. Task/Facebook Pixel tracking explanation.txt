*How to Validate if the Pixel is Firing?

*To validate the Facebook Pixel fires correctly, I would:

-Use Facebook Pixel Helper — a Chrome browser extension by Facebook that detects pixels on the page, shows whether they fired, and lists errors.

-Check Facebook Events Manager — after the pixel is implemented, Facebook’s dashboard shows real-time event tracking.

-Use browser developer tools — in the Network tab, there are requests to https://www.facebook.com/tr or the pixel script fbevents.js.

-Check server logs or analytics if I have access to backend data.
