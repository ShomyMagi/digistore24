*A brief explanation of the Maropost task:

-Due to Maropost’s enterprise restrictions and required business verification, I could not get access to the actual dashboard.
-As a workaround, I’ve created a fully functional and styled mock form that simulates the behavior of a real Maropost email registration module.
-This includes validation, success handling, and responsiveness.
-Once access is granted, the mock form can be replaced with the Maropost embed snippet.
