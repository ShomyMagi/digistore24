*Brief Explanation of the task:

-I created an email list in Mailchimp named "Test Registration List" and used Mailchimp’s embedded form builder to generate a registration form.
-I integrated the form into a custom-built, responsive landing page and applied modern, clean styling using CSS.
-I tested the form locally to ensure full functionality — email addresses are successfully collected, subscribers appear in the Mailchimp list, and a redirect occurs after a successful submission.
